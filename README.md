# pyCAJ2PDF #
This project intends to develop a script to convert the annoying CAJ/NH files into PDF format, with the help of pyPDF.  
It is still in very early stages, and even cannot read the CAJ properly at the moment......  
The script itself is not written yet, the repo only has a simple test script.

# About CAJ Files #
[CAJ Files](http://baike.baidu.com/view/129891.htm) are used for China Academic Journals Database, whose format is similar to PDF in some ways.  
But it can **ONLY** be viewed by CAJViewer, which is very big and useless in my opinion.  

## NH Files ##
Maybe it is similar to CAJ, but I haven't analyzed it yet
